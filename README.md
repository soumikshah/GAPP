# GAPP
It was an Individual academic project for Advanced Web programming (CS520) where I used Spring MVC framework. I have developed a web
based system which hosted all the application materials.Students will use CSUMentor to submit a university application and use GAPP to
submit a department application. University admission staff will upload scanned transcripts to GAPP. Department staff will upload
additional application materials (e.g. personal statement, recommendation letters) to GAPP., Department admission committee will use GAPP
to review the applications. Subversion was used for version controlling, Hibernate was used to map a object oriented domain to relational
database (PostGreSql)
